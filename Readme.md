# Express Contrib
      
  Adds async configuration support to Express.

## Installation

npm:

```bash
$ npm install express-configure
```

## Usage

Ever wanted to boot your Express app settings using Redis or a similar key/value store before accepting connections? well now it is easy, all we need to do is `require('express-configure')` which monkey-patches express, and then invoke the optional callback `configure()`.

```javascript
app.configure(function(done){
  redis.hgetall('settings', function(err, obj){
	for (var key in obj) app.set(key, obj[key]);
	done();
  });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## Running Tests

First make sure you have the submodules:

```bash
$ git submodule update --init
```

Then run the tests:

```bash
$ make test
```
